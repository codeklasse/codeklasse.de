### Side notes to be converted into docs somewhen
Thank god this installation kind'a got rolling on my Linux system via [bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/).
There was still a problem with the gem installation,
but it was *somehow magically* resolved via this [GitHub comment](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/4555#issuecomment-933369147).
