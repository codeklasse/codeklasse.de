MINT (STEM) is a collective term for:
<br>
<br>
- **M**athematics
- **I**nformation Technology (Computer Science)
- **N**atural Sciences
- **T**echnology
<br>
<br>

Germany's schools are currently not sufficiently equipped with know-how and resources to meet the enormously high demand for STEM workers from the business sector.
We founded codeklasse to counteract this deficit in STEM education.
